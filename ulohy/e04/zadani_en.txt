Define module `StringExtensions`, `NumericExtensions`, `ArrayExtensions`.
Into the first one, insert methods `palindrom?` and `separate_by?`, into
the second one `power_of_2?`, and into the third module `build_hash_from`
and `palindroms_count` from the task E02. Modify the implementation so
that it doesn't take arguments to perform operations on, but rather
use the data from the object itself (using keyword `self`).

After doing that, include the modules into classes `String`, `Numeric` and
`Array`. Try, that the included methods work on all the objects (e.g.
`4.power_of_2? # => true`).
