Copy script with methods from previous task, rename it to e02_methods.rb.
Simplify the implementation using iterators (at least in palindroms_count, power_of_2? and build_hash_from)
Copy the test script too and make sure your changes didn't break any test.

Then create a script morse_coder.rb which defines two methods - enconde and decode. They
will accept one string argument which they encode (or decode) to morse code.
For encoding and decoding use a file morse.rb, which defines constant MORSE.
As a separator between letters in morse code use pipe |. Separator between
words should remain as spaces.

Then create another script that loads morse_coder.rb and calls both encode and decode
on a string to verify it returns the same result

Example

  # encode('hello world') should return '....|.|.-..|.-..|--- .--|---|.-.|.-..|-..'
  # decode(encode('hello world')) # => 'hello_world'
