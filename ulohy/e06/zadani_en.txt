Define your own exception `MorseCoder::InvalidTransmitter` and raise
it in the `MorseCoder` class from the task E05, if the given
`transmitter` doesn't implement method `puts`.

Create a script, that will read file `morse_input.txt` and run its
content though the `MorseCoder` using `DebugTransmitter`. Update then
the script so that the input file will be given as a first argument
passed on the script in command line. If no file is given, it will use
`more_input.txt` as a default.

Create a script that will use a file handler of opened
`morse_output.txt` as a `transmitter` and it will write the encoded
text into the same file. Make sure to open the file for writing. The
method `transmit` should be able to handle the state when the file is
opened for read-only and it should print an adequate message.
